pgvector is an open-source extension for PostgreSQL that adds support for vector similarity search. Unfortunately, [Fly.io](https://fly.io) does not support pgvector by default.

In this article, I'll show you step by step how to migrate an existing Fly.io PostgreSQL database to use pgvector.

# Use a Custom Docker Image

To install pgvector on Fly.io, you need to modify the existing `flyio/postgres-flex` Docker image. I've created a new Dockerfile using `postgres-flex` as the base but with pgvector installed.

```dockerfile
FROM flyio/postgres-flex:16.4

RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
        git \
        build-essential

RUN apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends postgresql-server-dev-16

WORKDIR /home

RUN git clone --branch v0.7.4 https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector.git
WORKDIR /home/pgvector
RUN make
RUN make install

docker build -t andrebrito16/pgvector-fly . --platform "linux/amd64"
```

You’ll need to upload this Docker image to an existing container registry, but I’ve already done this, and the image is available at [andrebrito16/pgvector-fly](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/andrebrito16/pgvector-fly/general).

# Migrate an Existing Database Without Losing Data

If you’re already using a PostgreSQL database on Fly.io, you can migrate without data loss. First, identify the latest snapshot volume.
Go to your application on the dashboard, find the database, select volumes, choose the volume, and scroll down until you find the volume snapshots. Copy the volume ID; it should be something like vs_XXXXXXXXXXXX.
Now run the following command to create a new PostgreSQL database using the custom Docker image and the previous volume. Remember to replace vs_xxxxxxxxxxx with the volume ID you copied before. Also, change the name as needed.

```bash
fly postgres create \
  --snapshot-id vs_xxxxxxxxxxx \
  --volume-size 1 \
  --image-ref andrebrito16/pgvector-fly \
  --name postgres-with-pg-vector
```

This command will output the credentials of the new database, save it on a safe place. Now you just need to add the environment variables to your application.

# Conclusion

pgvector is an amazing and very useful extension, and as you can see, it’s easy to deploy it on Fly.io. If you want to build a custom image with more extensions, just modify the Dockerfile to fit your requirements.
